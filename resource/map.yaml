# Required fields:
#     image : Path to the image file containing the occupancy data; can be absolute, or relative to the location of the YAML file
#     resolution : Resolution of the map, meters / pixel
#     origin : The 2-D pose of the lower-left pixel in the map, as (x, y, yaw), with yaw as counterclockwise rotation (yaw=0 means no rotation). Many parts of the system currently ignore yaw.
#     occupied_thresh : Pixels with occupancy probability greater than this threshold are considered completely occupied.
#     free_thresh : Pixels with occupancy probability less than this threshold are considered completely free.
#     negate : Whether the white/black free/occupied semantics should be reversed (interpretation of thresholds is unaffected)
#     Optional parameter:
#     mode : Can have one of three values: trinary, scale, or raw. Trinary is the default. More information on how this changes the value interpretation is in the next section.

#     Value Interpretation
#     Given a pixel that has a COLOR value x in the range [0, 256), how should we interpret this value when put into the ROS message? First we convert integer x to a floating point number p depending on the interpretation of the negate flag from the yaml.
#     If negate is false, p = (255 - x) / 255.0. This means that black (0) now has the highest value (1.0) and white (255) has the lowest (0.0).
#     If negate is true, p = x / 255.0. This is the non-standard interpretation of images, which is why it is called negate, even though the math indicates that x is not negated. Nomenclature is hard.
#     Trinary
#     The standard interpretation is the trinary interpretation, i.e. interpret all values so that the output ends up being one of three values.
#     If p > occupied_thresh, output the value 100 to indicate the cell is occupied.
#     If p < free_thresh, output the value 0 to indicate the cell is free.
#     Otherwise, output -1 a.k.a. 255 (as an unsigned char), to indicate that the cell is unknown.
#     Scale
#     This tweaks the above interpretation to allow for more output values than trinary.
#     As before if p > occupied_thresh, output the value 100. If p < free_thresh, output the value 0.
#     Otherwise, output 99 * (p - free_thresh) / (occupied_thresh - free_thresh)
#     This will allow you to output a full gradient of values ranging from [0, 100]. To output -1, simply use the alpha channel of a png, where any transparency will be interpreted as unknown.
#     Raw
#     This mode will output x for each pixel, so output values are [0, 255].
